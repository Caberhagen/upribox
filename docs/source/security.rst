Security
########

When we designed the upribox architecture and features security was
the first thing on our minds.
We wanted to create a box that protects your privacy while surfing
the web and we knew that our ambitions would be in vain if we
endangered this valuable asset with the mechanisms that were supposed
to guard it. For this reason every new feature has to undergo a strict
security evaluation before it is rolled out to you. In this process we
test the new feature in its entirety and validate that the other
security mechanism are still intact.
The following chapter covers these security mechanisms and features
and tries to give you additional understanding of our thoughts behind
them:

General Security

Unattended Upgrades
===================

The software package unattended-upgrades is responsible for
automatically keeping the upribox current with the latest security
updates. We configured your upribox in a way that it searches for
important updates every day and installs them without the need of
any interaction with you.
In more detail the package will perform the following tasks:

- update the package lists
- download upgradeable packages
- upgrade packages
- remove downloaded packages that are not available anymore in
  the sources (every three weeks)

Passwords
=========

If you ordered a fully assembled upribox from our website you will
find your passwords for the web interface, SSH and both WiFis in
the included manual. These passwords were generated with a
cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG)
which means that the program that created the passwords used
operating system specific randomness sources which leads to high
unpredictability.
Upriboxes that you assembled yourself with the provided community
image are pre-configured with passwords that can be changed in the
web interface. Only secure passwords with a minimum of 8 characters
containing lower-case, upper-case, numbers and special characters
are accepted by the system.


SSH/VPN Keys
============

When generating a new profile for OpenVPN we create a new pair of
certificate (also known as public key) and private key for this
profile.
Furthermore, we ensure that every upribox has different SSH and
VPN keys by re-generating them automatically upon the first boot
on every bought upribox but also on upriboxes that you built with
the community image.

Least Privilege
===============

The upribox architecture follows the principle of least privilege.
This means that every part of the system (such as a process,
script or user) is only able to access and modify those parts of
the system that are necessary for the completion of its tasks.
One example for this implementation is that only the central
configuration script *upri-config.py* (see :ref:`django-label`)
is able to modify files with root privileges.

.. _logs:

Logs
====

Your upribox saves log files in memory instead of the SD card.
This helps to extend the life time of the card and protects your
privacy since data on the RAM disk are deleted regularly.

User Statistics
===============

To calculate the necessary data for the statistics the upribox
aggregates and anonymizes information by calculating the sum of
blocked contents and filtered domains over a specific time.
This procedure ensures that nobody can make assumptions about
another user's internet behaviour.
Furthermore, the calculated information is only stored on the
upribox itself and never leaves it.

************
Cryptography
************

Raspberry Pi Hardware RNG
=========================

A common problem with small devices like the upribox is that
the hardware and the operating system do not provide enough
entropy for a cryptographically secure generation of random
numbers. This is a crucial requirement for a fast and secure
calculation of keys. The Raspberry Pi has an included random
number generator in its hardware. To feed the Raspberry Pi
hardware RNG to the entropy pool at */dev/random* that is used
in the upribox' Python scripts the package *rng-tools* is
installed.

Certificate Pinning
===================

To get the latest filter rules your upribox communicates with
our backend server which provides a self-signed SSL certificate
to ensure the authenticity of the received updates. Your
upribox uses certificate pinning to associate the server with
the expected certificate and is so able to detect an attempted
attack immediately.

Strong Ciphers/Hashes for OpenVPN
=================================

For the VPN feature of the upribox we use OpenVPN which is
*not* executed as root and uses the strong cryptographic hash
function SHA384 for the packet HMAC authentication and AES-256
(CBC mode) for encryption.
